# Module_14_Challenge
Algorithmic trading

Algorithmic trading uses technical indicators and conditional logic to identify signals for entering and exiting trades. First, we’ll learn how to build a simple trading algorithm. Later in the module, we’ll apply our knowledge of machine learning from earlier modules to evaluate the trading decisions of our algorithm. (We can use machine learning to quickly and efficiently evaluate the performance of trading algorithms.) Understanding how trading algorithms perform on past data offers insight into how they might behave in future market conditions. And, this ultimately leads to better trading decisions, improved portfolio performance, and increased profits.
